        <h1>Predefined methods</h1>
        <h2>What are those predefined methods&#63;</h2>
        <p>Predefined methods like seen in picture below are methods already included in RedLoader mod template which we will use to actually make our first mod.</p>
        
        <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnInitializeMod()
{
    // Do your early mod initialization which doesn't involve game or sdk references here
    Config.Init();
}

protected override void OnSdkInitialized()
{
    // Do your mod initialization which involves game or sdk references here
    // This is for stuff like UI creation, event registration etc.
    ModExampleUi.Create();
}

protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    // This is called once the player spawns in the world and gains control.
}    
        </code></pre>
        
        <h2><q>OnInitializeMod</q> method</h2>
        <p>
            This method gets executed right after starting the game, before it loads into the main menu, and so probably during the RedLoader splashscreen.
            <br>If you played with mods before, you may know almost every mod comes with a <q><b>.cfg</b></q> file located in the <b>Userdata</b> folder with which you can set different options/settings for the mod.
            <br>The <b>OnInitializeMod</b> method we're talking about here, it's usually used to manage these config files for the mod (known as <q><b>.cfg</b></q> files).
        </p>
        
        <h2><q>OnSdkInitialized</q> method</h2>
        <p>
            This methods gets executed after the <b>OnInitializeMod</b> method and right before loading into the main menu.
            <br>Stuff that needs to get executed only once and doesn't really involve gameplay should be done in here. 
            Examples are the creation of an UI using <a href="https://tonimacaroni.github.io/RedLoader/api/SUI.html">SUI</a>,
            or <a href="https://tonimacaroni.github.io/RedLoader/articles/sounds.html?q=sound">registering custom sounds</a>.
        </p>

        <h2><q>OnGameStart</q> method</h2>
        <p>
            This methods gets executed right before we finished loading into a savegame and we gain player control.
            <br>Since at this point we are basically loaded into the game, here we can do stuff with the player and world.
            <br>Note that this method get executed whenever we load into a savegame, so exiting to main menu and<br>loading into the 
            same or another savegame will trigger it again unlike the two methods above which are executed only once.
            <br>This will also be the method we'll use to make our first mod.
