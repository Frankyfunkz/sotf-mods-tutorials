        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            All mods tutorials in here are made for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/RedLoader">RedLoader</a>, the mod RedLoader
            specifically made for SonsOfTheForest by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ToniMacaroni">ToniMacaroni</a>.
        </p>

        <p>I'm not in any way a real programmer nor do computer stuff for work in every day life. All I write comes from experience and
             trial and errors after learning a bit of c++,<br>which then shifted to c# to code <a target="_blank" href="https://sotf-mods.com/profile/imaxel">these type of mods</a> .
             This also mean that if you you have 0 programming knowledge &#40;like not knowing what a variable is&#41;
             it may be<br>really hard to actually make a mod which is something more than like changing the player speed.
             That's why I also include a <a href="../Cs-basics/disclaimer/disclaimer.html" target="pointed-iframe">C&#35; Basics</a> course
             which can give a way to start.
