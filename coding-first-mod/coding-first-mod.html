        <h1>Coding your first mod</h1>

        <h2 id="creating-the-mod-project">Creating the mod project</h2>
        
        <p>
            To create the mod project, open up RedModManager and navigate to the <b>Modding</b> tab.
            <br>
            If not already, install the <b>RedLoader mod template</b> using the button on screen.               
            <br>Give a name to the mod like <q>PlayerSpeedMod</q> and click the <b>Create Project</b> button.
            <img style="display: block" src="images/ModCreation.png" width="450px">
            Choose a folder in which the mod project will be created and you will be presented with a folder like this
            <img style="display: block" src="images/ModProjectFolder.png" width="600px">
            Now open the .sln file and you will now have the mod project opened and ready to work with in Visual Studio.
        </p>

        <h2 id="coding-the-mod">Coding the mod</h2>
        <p>
            As you can see we have our three predefined methods we talked about before plus one which we won't need right now.
        </p>
    
        <pre><code class="language-cs">
using SonsSdk;

namespace PlayerSpeedMod;

public class PlayerSpeedMod : SonsMod
{
    public PlayerSpeedMod()
    {

        //HarmonyPatchAll = true;
    }

    protected override void OnInitializeMod()
    {
        Config.Init();
    }

    protected override void OnSdkInitialized()
    {
        PlayerSpeedModUi.Create();
    }

    protected override void OnGameStart()
    {
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            For this mod we will only need to use <b>OnGameStart</b> because we don't need to create/use a config file nor making an UI etc. 
            <br>The focus is to only change the player walk and run speed, and <b>hear hear hear...</b> you are only 2 lines of code away from it&#33;
            <br>But before we do that, we need to add a reference to a game dll which contains informations about the Player.
            <br>In this case the .dll is named <q><b>Sons.dll</b></q>. In addition to containing references about the Local Player, 
            this one also contains many other references that will vastly expand the modding capabilities.
            <br>We can say it's like the main dll, and you will use it most if not all the times you make a mod.
        </p>

        <h2 id="adding-dll-reference">Adding a .dll reference to the mod project</h2>
        <p>
            To add a dll reference to the project head to the solution explorer &#40;on the right or left of the screen&#41;
            and right click on <b>Dependancies</b>, then <b>Add Project Reference...</b>, click <b>Browse...</b> on bottom
            <br>right corner and navigate to the game path that normally is &#40;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sons Of The Forest&#41;.
            <br>Open the <b>_RedLoader</b> folder and the <b>Game</b> folder.
            <br>These are all the dll's which contain informations about the game and that you can add as a reference to expand the modding capabilities.
            <br><br>
            For now and for this mod, we will just add <q><b>Sons.dll</b></q> because it's all we need to change the player speed.
            So select it, click on <b>Add</b> and then <b>OK</b> to confirm.
            <br>If you open the <b>Dependancies</b> dropdown menu in the solution explorer and then the <b>Assemblies</b> dropdown you can
            see all the dll's which are added as a reference to the mod project.
            <br>If you look closely, you will see that there is also our <q><b>Sons.dll</b></q> which we added before.
            
            <img style="display: block;" src="images/DependanciesView.png" width="200px">            
        </p>

        <h2 id="2-lines-of-code">Let's write these 2 lines of code!</h2>
        <p>
            As we said before, we only need two line of code to change the Player walk and run speed, and so accomplish our mod.
            <br>We will change the player speed right after the savegame has been loaded, so inside the <b>OnGameStart</b> method, since it's when the Player is created
            &#40;e.g we can't access the Player while we are in the main menu because it doesn't exist yet&#41;.
            <br><br>
            To use the <q><b>Sons.dll</b></q> we added before inside a .cs file we need to include it adding <q><b>using Sons</b></q> at the top of the page.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
using SonsSdk;
using Sons; // we added this line to use our referenced Sons.dll in this file

namespace PlayerSpeedMod;

public class PlayerSpeedMod : SonsMod
{
    public PlayerSpeedMod()
    {

        //HarmonyPatchAll = true;
    }

    protected override void OnInitializeMod()
    {
        Config.Init();
    }

    protected override void OnSdkInitialized()
    {
        PlayerSpeedModUi.Create();
    }

    protected override void OnGameStart()
    {

    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            <p>Now, inside our <b>OnGameStart</b> method we will write the mod code which will change the player speed.
            <br>To change the player speed we need to reference the LocalPlayer and then the FirstPersonCharacter.
            <br>To do so we write <q>LocalPlayer.FpCharacter</q>.
            <br>Now that we have control over our FirstPersonCharacter &#40;named FpCharacter here&#41;, we can change whatever it's available about it.
            <br>As we said before, we want to change the player walk and run speed.
            <br>To do so, we place another dot after <b>FpCharacter</b> and we will see a big list of options to choose from.
            <br>If we scroll down to the S, we can see stuff named SetWalkSpeed and SetRunSpeed.
            <br>So all we need to do to change the walk speed is to write: <q>LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetWalkSpeed(num value)</q>.
            <br>For example, try writing <q>LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetWalkSpeed(10)</q> for the player walk speed and 
            <q>LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetRunSpeed(20)</q> for the player run speed.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-cs">
protected override void OnGameStart()
{
    LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetWalkSpeed(10);
    LocalPlayer.FpCharacter.SetRunSpeed(20);
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2 id="building-the-mod">Building the mod</h2>
        <p>
            Congratulation, the mod is basically done! We only need to build it. 
            <br>To do so head on the top bar of Visual Studio and click on <b>Build</b>, then <b>Build Solution</b>. If everything went right, you will see the mod
            dll inside the Mods folder 
            <img style="display: block;" src="images/ModsFolder.png" width="650px">
        </p>

        <h2 id="testing-the-mod">Testing the mod</h2>
        <p>
            Now launch the game and in the mods tab look if there is our PlayerSpeedMod. If so, everything went right.
            <br>Now load into a savegame, and right before spawning your 2 lines of code will get executed, changing the player walk speed to 10 and run speed to 20,
             making the player move faster!
